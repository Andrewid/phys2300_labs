##PHYS 2300 Final

Arguments: Bucket Height and Radius. Spigot radius (to a point)

Problem statement:

>   Torricelli's Law

>   This physics problem is actually one that I

>   missed a good amount of points

>   on my final exam for PHYS 2210

>   This formula is based of Bernoulli's equation:

>   ρgy1 + ½ρv12 + P1 = ρgy2 + ½ρv22 +P2

>   Where the speed of the water dropping is negligible in relation

>   to the speed of the water exiting the "bucket"

>   From Wikipedia:

>   "Torricelli's law describes the parting speed of a jet of water,

>   based on the distance below the surface at which the jet starts,

>   assuming no air resistance, viscosity, or other hindrance to the fluid flow.

>   I will attempt to reproduce an animated version of this.

**Follow up work** is to add the ability to animate multiple holes with their
own droplet source taking from the same water level. This seems like a pretty
tricky task because I’ll need to make sure that the different droplet arrays
keep track of their own “allotment” of water (can’t take from water below their
own level)

I think the animation looks pretty nice and I’m pleased with how smoothly it
runs.
